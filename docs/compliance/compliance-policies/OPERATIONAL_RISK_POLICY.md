    def conduct_rcsa(self, business_unit):
        assessment_components = {
            'risk_identification': self.identify_risks(business_unit),
            'inherent_risk_rating': self.rate_inherent_risk(),
            'control_assessment': self.evaluate_controls(),
            'residual_risk_rating': self.calculate_residual_risk(),
            'action_plans': self.develop_action_plans()
        }
        
        return self.compile_rcsa_report(assessment_components)
```

#### 1.2 Risk Inventory Maintenance
**Risk Taxonomy:**
- Level 1: Risk Categories (Process, People, Systems, External)
- Level 2: Risk Subcategories (specific risk types)
- Level 3: Risk Events (granular risk scenarios)

### 2. Risk Assessment Methodology

#### 2.1 Risk Rating Criteria
**Likelihood Scale:**

3. Possible: 25-50% probability in 12 months
4. Likely: 50-75% probability in 12 months
5. Almost Certain: Greater than 75% probability in 12 months

**Impact Scale:**
1. Minimal: Less than $100K financial impact
2. Minor: $100K - $500K financial impact
3. Moderate: $500K - $2M financial impact
4. Major: $2M - $10M financial impact
5. Catastrophic: Greater than $10M financial impact

#### 2.2 Risk Heat Map
```python

            return business_indicator * 0.12
        elif business_indicator <= 30000000000:  # €30 billion
            return 120000000 + (business_indicator - 1000000000) * 0.15
        else:
            return 4470000000 + (business_indicator - 30000000000) * 0.18
    
    def calculate_internal_loss_multiplier(self, bucket_losses):
        # Loss component calculation
