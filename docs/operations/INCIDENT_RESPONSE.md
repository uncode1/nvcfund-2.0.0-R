## Response Procedures

### Phase 1: Detection and Reporting

#### Automated Detection
```bash
# Security monitoring
./scripts/security_monitor.sh --real-time

# Performance monitoring
./scripts/performance_monitor.sh --alerts

# System health monitoring
./scripts/health_monitor.sh --continuous
```

#### Manual Reporting
- **Internal**: Slack #incidents channel
- **External**: security@nvcfund.com
- **Emergency**: +1-xxx-xxx-INCIDENT

#### Initial Assessment
1. **Verify the incident** (5 minutes)
2. **Classify severity** (5 minutes)
3. **Assemble response team** (10 minutes)
4. **Establish communication channels** (5 minutes)

### Phase 2: Containment

#### Immediate Actions
```bash
# Isolate affected systems
./scripts/isolate_system.sh --system $AFFECTED_SYSTEM

# Preserve evidence
./scripts/preserve_evidence.sh --incident $INCIDENT_ID

# Implement temporary fixes
./scripts/emergency_patch.sh --issue $ISSUE_TYPE
```

#### Security Containment
- **Network Isolation**: Isolate compromised systems
- **Account Lockdown**: Disable compromised accounts
- **Service Shutdown**: Stop affected services if necessary
- **Evidence Preservation**: Capture system state and logs

#### Operational Containment
- **Traffic Rerouting**: Redirect traffic to healthy systems
- **Failover Activation**: Switch to backup systems
- **Load Reduction**: Implement rate limiting
- **Service Degradation**: Disable non-critical features

### Phase 3: Investigation

#### Evidence Collection
```bash
# System logs
./scripts/collect_logs.sh --incident $INCIDENT_ID --timeframe "last 24 hours"

# Network traffic
./scripts/capture_network.sh --duration 1h

# Memory dumps
./scripts/memory_dump.sh --system $AFFECTED_SYSTEM

# Database analysis
python scripts/db_forensics.py --incident $INCIDENT_ID
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Timeline Construction**: Sequence of events
2. **Impact Assessment**: Affected systems and data
3. **Attack Vector Analysis**: How the incident occurred
4. **Vulnerability Identification**: Security gaps exploited
5. **Attribution**: Internal vs external threat

### Phase 4: Eradication

#### Security Eradication
```bash
# Remove malware
./scripts/malware_removal.sh --system $AFFECTED_SYSTEM

# Patch vulnerabilities
./scripts/security_patches.sh --critical

# Update security controls
./scripts/update_security.sh --incident-based
```

#### System Cleanup
- **Malware Removal**: Clean infected systems
- **Vulnerability Patching**: Fix security holes
- **Configuration Updates**: Harden system settings
- **Access Revocation**: Remove unauthorized access

### Phase 5: Recovery

#### System Restoration
```bash
# Restore from backup
./scripts/restore_system.sh --backup-id $BACKUP_ID

# Verify system integrity
./scripts/integrity_check.sh --full-scan

# Gradual service restoration
./scripts/gradual_restore.sh --service-by-service
```

#### Validation Steps
- **Functionality Testing**: Verify all features work
- **Security Testing**: Confirm security measures
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure acceptable performance
- **Integration Testing**: Verify third-party connections

### Phase 6: Lessons Learned

#### Post-Incident Review
1. **Incident Timeline**: Detailed chronology
2. **Response Effectiveness**: What worked well
3. **Improvement Areas**: What could be better
4. **Action Items**: Specific improvements
5. **Documentation Updates**: Process improvements

#### Follow-up Actions
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement new controls
- **Process Updates**: Improve response procedures
- **Training Updates**: Address knowledge gaps
- **Monitoring Improvements**: Better detection capabilities
