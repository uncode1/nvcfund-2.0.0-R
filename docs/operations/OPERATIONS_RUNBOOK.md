open https://monitoring.nvcfund.com
```

#### 2. Initial Response
- [ ] Acknowledge alert within 5 minutes
- [ ] Assess severity and impact
- [ ] Notify stakeholders if P0/P1
- [ ] Begin investigation

#### 3. Investigation
```bash
# Check application logs
tail -f /var/log/nvcfund/application.log

# Database performance
python scripts/db_diagnostics.py

# Infrastructure metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics
```

#### 4. Resolution
- [ ] Implement fix or workaround
- [ ] Verify resolution
- [ ] Update stakeholders
- [ ] Document resolution

#### 5. Post-Incident
- [ ] Conduct post-mortem (P0/P1)
- [ ] Update runbooks
- [ ] Implement preventive measures
